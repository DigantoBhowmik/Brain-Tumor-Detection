# Brain-Tumor-Detection
1. The study contains a Binary dataset which is divided into two classes: Brain Tumor and Healthy Brain. 
2. Gaussian, Unsharp Mask, and Laplacian filters have been used on these datasets. 
3. Three pre-trained models-VGG19, ResNet50, MobileNetV2 and Scratched CNN- have been used. 
4. We applied feature extraction using a 1 Ã— 1024 feature vector.
5. After extract feature classified these features into tumor or healthy regions using three classifiers: Random Forest, KNN and AdaBoost. 
6. Our results demonstrates that the proposed approach outclasses some existing methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.91%.
